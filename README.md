My name is Dwight Crowell, and I a beginning my journey to become a computer programmer!

The languages I am currently tackling are:
- Python
- C
- The Linux Command Line

To help me learn Github and Git, I am working on the following mini projects
- A simple card game called "War"
- A dynamic gaming leaderboard

One of my hobbies which I share with my wife is astrophotography! 🔭  
We are mainly interested in Deep Sky Astrophotography, but also enjoy planetary.   
Check out the images and videos we have captured:
